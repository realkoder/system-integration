### WHat is resolvers

In GraphQL, resolvers are functions that are responsible for returning the data for a specific field in your schema. They act as the bridge between the GraphQL queries and the underlying data sources, such as databases, APIs, or other services. Each field in a GraphQL schema can have its own resolver function, allowing for fine-grained control over how data is fetched and returned.
