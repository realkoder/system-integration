# üö´ Exposing A DB with Granular Data Access üö´

This approach is a dockerized PostgreSQL databasse, where two _user-profiles_ have been configured: **postgres** and **user**.

The **postgres** _user-profile_ has full access rights to all _DDL_ and _DML_, while the **user** has certain restrictions. These restrictions are based on the most granular level of data access in _PostgreSQL_, which is at the field attribute level for a given table.

The _PostgreSQL_ database configured, is named _strict_music_database_, it's straightforward and consists of four tables:

- **artists**
- **songs**
- **albums**
- **song_album**.

For _user-profile_ **user** there have been made restrictions to accessing the field **secret_info** for **artists** table.

‚≠êÔ∏è You task is to figure out how you can perform **insertions** or **deletions** in another way when using the **user** _user-profile_? üîç

## Why PostgreSQL? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

_PostgreSQL_ was chosen for this task due to its robust support for granular data access control. It allows for precise permissions at the column level within tables, making it an ideal choice for creating differentiated user profiles with varying access levels, ensuring that users can only interact with data as intended by their role.

By utilizing **GRANT** and **REVOKE** commands, _PostgreSQL_ enables precise control over user permissions, ensuring a _user-profile_ can be finely tuned to access only the necessary data. This level of control is essential for enforcing strict data access policies, making PostgreSQL an ideal choice for managing granular permissions.

GRANT and REVOKE control access at the object level (e.g., tables, views), specifying what operations a user can perform. Row-Level Security (RLS) controls access at the row level within tables, based on user attributes or policies. While GRANT/REVOKE sets broad permissions, RLS allows for fine-grained, dynamic access control.

## Start integrating the exposed PostgreSQL

#### 1. Setting Up Local docker env üê≥

First start creating the environment for the needed two files (`docker-compose.yml` & `init.sql`):

Either copy the files to your own directory or `git clone https://github.com/realkoder/strict-db-granular-data-access.git`

üõë **Within the created directory** üõë you need top copy the following two files if you did not `git clone` the project `https://github.com/realkoder/strict-db-granular-data-access`:

- **docker-compose.yml**
- **init.sql**

<br>

#### 2. Interact with container üöÄ

Execute the following commands:

```bash
# Create the PostgreSQL dockerized container and boot it with docker-compose
docker compose up --build

# Access the running docker strictdb as user profile: user
docker exec -it strictdb psql -U user -d strict_music_database

# Access the running docker strictdb as super-user / postgres
docker exec -it strictdb psql -U postgres -d strict_music_database

# Go to section 3. Query the PostgreSQL

# Terminate the container and delete created volume
docker compose down -v
```

<br>

#### 3. Query the PostgreSQL

#### üåü Execute the following commands where the _user-profile_ is set to `user` üåü

> Interact with postgresql docker container by cmd: `docker exec -it strictdb psql -U user -d strict_music_database`

```sql
-- Try readng from artists -> maybe that's the restriction?
SELECT * FROM artists;

-- Read from artists successfully (since secret_info is omitted)
SELECT  id, artist_name, started_year, origin_country, still_active, website_url FROM artists;

-- Insert into artist but DENIED
INSERT INTO artists (artist_name, started_year, origin_country, still_active, website_url, secret_info) VALUES('SOME ARTIST', 2000, 'DK', FALSE, 'https://some-url.com', 'SOME SECRET');

-- Insert into artist successfully
INSERT INTO artists (artist_name, started_year, origin_country, still_active, website_url) VALUES('SOME ARTIST', 2000, 'DK', FALSE, 'https://some-url.com');
```
