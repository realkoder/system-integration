# üö´ Exposing A DB with Granular Data Access üö´

This approach is a dockerized PostgreSQL databasse, where two _user-profiles_ have been configured: **root** and **user**. 

The **postgres** profile has full access rights to everything, while the **user** has certain restrictions. These restrictions are based on the most granular level of data access in PostgreSQL, which is at the field attribute level for a given table.

The _PostgreSQL_ database configured, is named _strict_music_database_, it's straightforward and consists of four tables:
- **artists** 
- **songs** 
- **albums**
- **song_album**.

<br>

For the _user-profile_ **user** there have been made restrictions to accessing the field **secret_info** for **artists** table. Try to see how you do **insertions** or **deletions** else way using the **user** _user-profile_? üîç

## Why PostgreSQL? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

_PostgreSQL_ was chosen for this task due to its robust support for granular data access control. It allows for precise permissions at the column level within tables, making it an ideal choice for creating differentiated user profiles with varying access levels, ensuring that users can only interact with data as intended by their role.

By utilizing **GRANT** and **REVOKE** commands, _PostgreSQL_ enables precise control over user permissions, ensuring a _user-profile_ can be finely tuned to access only the necessary data. This level of control is essential for enforcing strict data access policies, making PostgreSQL an ideal choice for managing granular permissions.

GRANT and REVOKE control access at the object level (e.g., tables, views), specifying what operations a user can perform. Row-Level Security (RLS) controls access at the row level within tables, based on user attributes or policies. While GRANT/REVOKE sets broad permissions, RLS allows for fine-grained, dynamic access control.

## Setting Up Local docker env üê≥

First start creating the environment for the needed two files (`docker-compose.yml` & `init.sql`):

```bash
# Just an example
mkdir Integrator

cd Integrator
```

Within the created directory, you need top copy the following two files from this repository's filepath `01._Assignments/04._Server_To_Client/02._Database_Granular_Data_Access/01._Exposer`:

**docker-compose.yml & init.sql**.

<br>

Now it's time to start the container and interact with it - execute the following commands üöÄ

```bash
# Create the PostgreSQL dockerized container and boot it with docker-compose
docker compose up --build

# Access the running docker strictdb as user profile: user
docker exec -it strictdb psql -U user -d strict_music_database

# Access the running docker strictdb as super-user / postgres
docker exec -it strictdb psql -U postgres -d strict_music_database

# Terminate the container and delete created volume
docker compose down -v
```

<br>

## Commands to run

### üåü Execute the following commands where the _user-profile_ is set to `user` üåü
> Interact with postgresql docker container by this cmd: `docker exec -it strictdb psql -U user -d strict_music_database`

```sql
-- Read from artists but DENIED
SELECT * FROM artists;

-- Read from artists successfully (since secret_info is omitted)
SELECT  id, artist_name, started_year, origin_country, still_active, website_url FROM artists;

-- Insert into artist but DENIED
INSERT INTO artists (artist_name, started_year, origin_country, still_active, website_url) VALUES('MOCK Grips',2011,'DK',FALSE,'https://thirdworlds.net');

-- Insert into artist successfully
INSERT INTO artists (artist_name, started_year, origin_country, still_active, website_url, secret_info) VALUES('MOCK Grips',2011,'DK',FALSE,'https://thirdworlds.net', 'Some secrets');
```
