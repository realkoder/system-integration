# 08b [DLS Group] Generate code documentation for your DLS project ðŸ“‹

Been playing around with _TSDoc_ for the fun of it which generates a **README.md** based on code comments.

## DLS assignment based on Encore.ts

The assignments backend system is based upon **Encroe.ts** which is an Open Source TypeScript Backend Framework
for robust type-safe applications.
Encore provides a Service Catalog where it Automatically provides complete API docs for the whole **Encore** system.

## OpenAPI / Swagger docs for DIY DLS

Since _Encore_ was too strict in the way services could be shut down, scalled, monitored etc. we decided to build without relying on _Encore_. Instead we configured our own microservices using _NodeJs TypeScript_ and with _Express_ - _auth-gatekeeper_ handles all incoming requests and forwards them to specific services, such as _products-service_, which means each service needs its own configuration of _OpenAPI / Swagger_.

#### Bonus with Encore type-safe client API gen feature

**Encore** provides a script for generating a type-safe client using the most recent API metadata running in a particular environment for the given **Encore** application.

```json
// frontend-package.json scripts section
{
  "scripts": {
    "gen": "encore gen client backend-2tui --output=./app/lib/client.ts --env=local"
  }
}
```

Use the gen script

```bash
# Be placed in frontend-root and ensure encore app is running
npm run gen
```

The above will generate client for frontend to fetch from **Encore** application.
