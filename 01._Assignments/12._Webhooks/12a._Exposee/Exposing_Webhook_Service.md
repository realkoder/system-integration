# 12a Expose and Integrate with a Webhook System

The Webhook system is for clients to hook on to get updated in recents news from Reddit Channels.

## Event types

The event types can be in following formats:

```typescript
type TEventType = "PROGRAMMING" | "HOOROR" | "AI";
```

### Following section is addon regarding docs for deployment and configuring codebase with TS and ESM

## Deployment

Running a simple _Ubuntu virtual machine_ on _Linode_, where _nginx_ facilitates _TLS/HTTPS_ and forwards incoming requests to an _Express_ webhook server managed by _Docker Compose_.

Added a subdomain record for my domain _webhook.realkoder.com_:
![Added subdomain record: webhook](./images/subdomain-record.png)

Access the server to further configure:

```bash
ssh root@139.162.131.241
```

**Install required packages**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose

# nginx used for forwarding request and enabling https
sudo apt install nginx

sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d webhook.realkoder.com
```

Sucessfully created _TLS_ certificate with certbot
![successfull created tls certificate](./images/successfull-certificate.png)

Add the following to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` inside the _http_ section:

```nginx
	server {
	  listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot
    server_name webhook.realkoder.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/webhook.realkoder.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/webhook.realkoder.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
	    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
	    proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
	    proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

When `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` have been updated _nginx_ have to be restarted to enable new configs:
```bash
# Always check nginx.conf is valid
nginx -t

systemctl restart nginx
```

---

**PUSHING DOCKER IMAGE TO GHCR FROM LOCAL DEV ENV**
```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.prod -t ghcr.io/realkoder/sys-int-webhook-app:latest .

docker push ghcr.io/realkoder/sys-int-webhook-app:latest
```

---

Add the following `docker-compose.yml` file to _linode ubuntu vm_:
```yml
services:
  webhook-app:
    image: ghcr.io/realkoder/webhook-app:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./assets:/app/assets
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
```

**DOCKER ghcr.io LOGIN**
```bash
docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --pasword GHCR_TOKEN
```

Ensure that the _ubuntu machine_ has access to **GHCR** and run `docker-compose up`

## Info about configuring express app with TypeScript, Nodemon & ESM

_NodeJS_ RESTAPI backend served by _express_.

So I wanted to have the following setup:

- _nodeJS_ served with `express`
- Using `ESM modules` instead of `commonjs`
- Configured with `typescript`
- Dev mode using `nodemon` for live reloading based on codechanges.

---

Experienced a lot of issues configuring the developer environment since _TypeScript_ is precompiled and interupting nodemon.
Finally managed to do all the config enabling `typescript` with `ESM modules` and live reload by `nodemon`.

Got this error a lot `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true }); ReferenceError: exports is not defined in ES module scope` which was related to the use of ESM modules instead of commonJS.

Also followed this guide https://webdev852.medium.com/node-typescript-app-with-nodemon-and-type-module-3e25bfcaa8b0 but took me a while to figure out that the `tsconfig.json` was corrupt since it did then spell `compilerOptions` correctly, and therefor the guide did'nt work either ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

After a lot of debugging this was the golden way to create the whole codebase with typescript, ESM modules, express, cors, nodemon:

Config with typescript:

```bash
mkdir backend-app

cd backend-app

npm init -y

npm install express cors @types/cors @types/express @types/node nodemon ts-node typescript
```

Add following to `package.json` --> `"type": "module"` & `"dev": "nodemon --config nodemon.json"`

Add following tsconfig.json

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext", // or "ES2020"
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "target": "es2021",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "lib": ["es2021"]
}
```

Add following nodemon.json

```json
{
  "watch": ["src"],
  "ext": "ts",
  "exec": "node --loader ts-node/esm ./src/app.ts"
}
```
